This documentation describes the a9s Elasticsearch for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF) tile. a9s Elasticsearch for PCF
enables on-demand provisioning of VM-based, dedicated Elasticsearch servers and clusters. Developers can
create instances of a Elasticsearch server or cluster using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command Line
interface (cf CLI) and bind these instances to an application.
Depending on your service plan, a service instance may be associated with a single, dedicated VM
or a set of VMs consisting of multiple VMs containing a Elasticsearch replica set cluster.

## <a id='overview'></a>Overview

When you run the cf CLI ```create-service a9s-elasticsearch``` command,
PCF creates dedicated VMs for this service instance. This allows
the best possible bad neighborhood protection.

Elasticsearch service instance provisioning, including VM orchestration, is entirely automated.
This enables service instances to be highly isolated and shielded by infrastructure virtualization
mechanisms.

Due to the on-demand provisioning on VMs, only existing service
instances allocate infrastructure resources. These resources are released when service
instances are destroyed. Using on-demand provisioning the number of
service instances is not limited by design.

Distributed across multiple infrastructure availability zones,  clustered data
service plans enable short failover times and are resilient against
failures of individual infrastructure hosts or entire availability zones.

### <a id='currentfeatures'></a>Current Features

The current version of a9s Elasticsearch for PCF includes the following key features:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **OnÂ­-Demand Service Instance Provisioning** | a9s Elasticsearch for PCF deploys Elasticsearch instances automatically. Developers can provision a single-VM Elasticsearch server or a multi-VM Elasticsearch Replica Set using a single command. |
| **Service Instance Isolation** | Each Elasticsearch server runs on a dedicated VM to ensure bad neighborhood protection in order to be aligned with enterprise security requirements.<br/><br/>a9s Elasticsearch for PCF uses Cloud Foundry security groups to prevent network connections being established by unauthorized applications.
| **High Availability** | a9s Elasticsearch for PCF ensures high-availability.<br/><br/>The Consul-based internal DNS system provided by a9s Consul DNS for PCF ensures that the connected application always connects to a working node. |
| **Smoke Tests** | a9s Elasticsearch for PCF contains a post-deploy smoke tests errand that runs a series of basic test against your installation to ensure that it is configured properly. |
| **Service Instance Capacity Upgrade** | Cloud Foundry Service Plan updates allow upgrades to the RAM, CPU and storage capacity for your Elasticsearch instances. |
| **Logging and Monitoring** | Each Elasticsearch service instance provides log messages and Elasticsearch-specific metrics to one or more `syslog/graphite` endpoints. You can configure the `syslog/graphite` endpoint to receive logging and monitoring information. |
| **Deployment Updater** | This errand automatically updates the stemcell and all provisioned a9s Elasticsearch for PCF service instances to their lastest version. |
| **Backup Manager** | The Backup Manager does regular backup of your instances and offers endpoints to backup instantly and restore backups. |
| **Service Guard** | The Service Guard creates Cloud Foundry security groups for your service instance VMs.<br /><br /> When the IP address of a service instance changes, the guard updates the security group. The Service Guard also restarts the application instances bound to the affected service instance. **The instances of one application are restarted one by one to avoid downtime.**|
| **Service Dashboard** | The Service Dashboard provides a single sign on and lets the user trigger easily backups. |
| **New Elasticsearch Versions** | Added a9s Elasticsearch 5 and 6 |
