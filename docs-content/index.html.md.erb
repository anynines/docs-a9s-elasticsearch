This documentation describes the a9s Elasticsearch for Pivotal Platform
tile. a9s Elasticsearch for Pivotal Platform enables on-demand provisioning of VM-based, dedicated
Elasticsearch servers and clusters. Developers can create instances of a
Elasticsearch server or cluster using Apps Manager or the Cloud Foundry Command
Line interface (cf CLI) and bind these instances to an application. Depending on
your service plan, a service instance may be associated with a single, dedicated
VM or a set of VMs consisting of multiple VMs containing a Elasticsearch replica
set cluster.

## <a id='overview'></a> Overview

When you run the cf CLI `create-service a9s-elasticsearch` command, Pivotal Platform creates
dedicated VMs for this service instance. This allows the best possible bad
neighborhood protection.

Elasticsearch service instance provisioning, including VM orchestration, is entirely
 automated. This enables service instances to be highly isolated and shielded by
 infrastructure virtualization mechanisms.

Due to the on-demand provisioning on VMs, only existing service instances allocate
infrastructure resources. These resources are released when service instances
are destroyed. Using on-demand provisioning the number of service instances is
not limited by design.

Distributed across multiple infrastructure availability zones, clustered data
service plans enable short failover times and are resilient against failures of
individual infrastructure hosts or entire availability zones.

### <a id='currentfeatures'></a> Current Features

The current version of a9s Elasticsearch for Pivotal Platform includes the following key features:

| Feature | Benefit |
|---------|---------|
| **OnÂ­-Demand Service Instance Provisioning** | a9s Elasticsearch for Pivotal Platform deploys Elasticsearch instances automatically. Developers can provision a single VM Elasticsearch server or a multi VM Elasticsearch Replica Set using a single command. |
| **Service Instance Isolation** | Each Elasticsearch server runs on a dedicated VM to ensure bad neighborhood protection in order to be aligned with enterprise security requirements.<br/><br/>a9s Elasticsearch for Pivotal Platform uses Cloud Foundry security groups to prevent network connections being established by unauthorized applications.
| **High Availability** | a9s Elasticsearch for Pivotal Platform ensures high-availability.<br/><br/>The Consul-based internal DNS system provided by a9s Consul DNS for Pivotal Platform ensures that the connected application always connects to a working node. |
| **Smoke Tests** | a9s Elasticsearch for Pivotal Platform contains a post-deploy smoke tests errand that runs a series of basic test against your installation to ensure that it is configured properly. |
| **Service Instance Capacity Upgrade** | Cloud Foundry Service Plan updates allow upgrades to the RAM, CPU and storage capacity for your Elasticsearch instances. |
| **Logging and Monitoring** | Each Elasticsearch service instance provides log messages and Elasticsearch-specific metrics to one or more `syslog/graphite` endpoints. You can configure the `syslog/graphite` endpoint to receive logging and monitoring information. |
| **Deployment Updater** | This errand automatically updates the stemcell and all provisioned a9s Elasticsearch for Pivotal Platform service instances to their lastest version. |
| **Backup Manager** | The Backup Manager does regular backup of your instances and offers endpoints to backup instantly and restore backups. |
| **Service Guard** | The Service Guard creates Cloud Foundry security groups for your service instance VMs.<br /><br /> When the IP address of a service instance changes, the guard updates the security group. |
| **Service Dashboard** | The Service Dashboard provides single sign on and lets the user easily trigger backups. |
| **New Elasticsearch Versions** | Added a9s Elasticsearch v5 and v6 |
| **Default Syslog Endpoints for Instances** | In the tile, a default endpoint for syslog and Graphite can be configured for each service instance created by the user. |
| **Consul Domain Configurable** | The consul domain can now be configured. |
| **BOSH DNS Handler** | a9s BOSH DNS handler added to make a9s service instances accessible from Diego cells. |
| **a9s-pg Backup** | Added backup option for a9s-pg. |
| **Instance Sharing** | a9s MySQL no supports instance sharing between orgs an spaces, see [documentation](https://docs.pivotal.io/pivotalcf/2-6/devguide/services/sharing-instances.html). |
| **Update to Xenial** | Upgrades the stemcell to Ubuntu Xenial |
