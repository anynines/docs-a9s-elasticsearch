***Added***

- all services: a9s Dashboard API: min length of encryption key is configurable
- a9s Dashboard API: Add endpoint to prepare a disaster recovery for a given
  service instance.
- all services: a9s Deployer: Use deployment name to create and find a deployment.
- all services: Add flexible service plans. For more information see the
  [Service Plans](docs/platform-operator/service_plans.md) documentation.

  contains additional information about the service instance and the used
  filter_plugins in the a9s Backup Agent.
- a9s Elasticsearch, a9s MongoDB, a9s PostgreSQL, a9s RabbitMQ:
  allow the user to provide their own x509 (SSL/TLS) certificates via the
  user_params `cacrt`, `wildcrt`, and `wildkey` or let the SPI generate them
  for the user. See [anynines SSL/TLS Service Plans](docs/application-developer/common/ssl_plans.md)
  to learn more. As a platform operator, you can also provide an certificate
  authority which will be used to create and sign certificates for each service
  instance of that service. See [Common SSL/TLS configuration](docs/platform-operator/common-tls-configuration.md)
  to learn more.
- a9s Backup Service: Add support for a9s Harbor backups.
- a9s Backup Service: The backup create request now returns also the id of the backup.

  restore view gets shown properly.

  To delete obsolete metadata files from already deleted backups have a
  look at the [administration.md](docs/platform-operator/administration.md#delete-obsolete-backup-metadata-files).
- all services: a9s Deployer: The a9s Deployer now properly catches and saves
  the return values from the BOSH Director in case the BOSH Task fails.
  Fetching instance information now properly returns the instance data with a
  `failed` status instead of `422`.
- a9s Backup Service: Fix migration of encryption key into a new column for
  shorter encryption keys than the current limit.
- a9s Backup Service: generate a9s Harbor Service Broker password.
- a9s Backup Manager: Fix an issue where under special circumstances the backup
  encryption key is not stored in the database.
- a9s Backup Manager: Move database migration into a pre-start script to
  mitigate timeout issue with the start script.
- a9s Dashboard API: Replaced logger to redact sensitive data in logs.
- a9s SSO-Proxy: The SSO-Proxy application returns now the HTTP Code
  `401 unauthorized` if the CF Auth Token is expired or invalid.

- all services: a9s Service Dashboard: Per default deleted backups are not
  displayed in the a9s Service Dashboard anymore.
- all services: a9s Backup-Agent: Improve backup mechanism for backups bigger
  than 1 GB and improve restore.
- a9s PostgreSQL, a9s Elasticsearch, a9s RabbitMQ, a9s MongoDB: SPI: updates the behaviour of the SPI, if you added
  an intermediate certificate authority to a data service, the service instances will be updated with a certificate signed by
  that new CA on the next update operation. You can use the deployment updater to update existing service instances.
- all services: a9s Service Broker: The a9a Service Broker requests
  `available_updates` from the a9s Deployer only when the information is needed.
