This topic describes how to install and configure a9s Elasticsearch for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).

##<a id='prerequisites'></a> Prerequisites

Before installing a9s Elasticsearch for PCF, ensure that you have installed and configured the products and tiles listed in [Requirements](./index.html#reqs).

##<a id='install'></a> Install a9s Elasticsearch for PCF

1. Download the product file from [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/a9s-elasticsearch).

2. Navigate to the Ops Manager Installation Dashboard and click **Import a Product**
to upload the product file.

3. Click **Add** next to the uploaded a9s Elasticsearch for PCF tile in the Ops Manager
**Available Products** view to add it to your staging area.

4. Click the newly added tile and select **Settings** > 
**Assign AZs and Networks**.

5. Configure the location of service instance jobs. 
   Configure your network to balance cluster jobs between as many AZs as possible.

6. (Optional) Review the remaining configuration panes. 
   For more information on how to configure the properties of each pane, see the following:
	* [Errands](#errands)
	* [Resource Config](#resource-config)
	* [Stemcell](#stemcell)

6. Click **Apply Changes** to deploy the service.

##<a id="configure-service-instance"></a> Configure Service Plan VMs

You can configure the dimensions of the VMs used to provision *service instances* of a given *service plan* 
in the **IaaS Settings** pane of the a9s BOSH for PCF tile.

The following table describes which [Cloud-Config fields](http://docs.pivotal.io/a9s-bosh/installing.html#cloud-config) 
in the a9s BOSH for PCF tile correspond to which a9s Elasticsearch for PCF service plans.

<table>
	<tr>
		<th width="35%">Service Plan</th>
		<th>Cloud-Config Fields</th>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<code>elasticsearch-single-small</code>
			<code>elasticsearch-cluster-small</code>
		</td>
		<td>
			Cloud properties of the VM Type Small<br /> 
			Cloud properties of the Disk Type Small
		</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<td>
			<code>elasticsearch-single-big</code><br>
			<code>elasticsearch-cluster-big</code>
		</td>
		<td>
			Cloud properties of the VM Type Big<br /> 
			Cloud properties of the Disk Type Big
		</td>
	</tr>
</table>

For information about setting VM dimensions, see [About Configuring a9s BOSH for PCF](http://docs.pivotal.io/a9s-bosh/installing.html#configure).

##<a id='configure'></a> Configure a9s Elasticsearch for PCF

The following sections describe the optional configuration panes in the a9s Elasticsearch for PCF tile.

### <a id='errands'></a>Errands

The **Errands** pane lists <a href="https://bosh.io/docs/terminology.html#errand" target="_blank"> BOSH errands</a> 
executed by the tile. 
For information about what each errand does and guidance for activating or deactivating each errand, see the following table:

<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Errand</th>
    <th>Description</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Run BOSH Configurator</td>
    <td>Uploads the releases required to the a9s BOSH Director so that a9s BOSH for PCF can provision Elasticsearch instances.
        Deactivating this errand may speed up the deployment of tiles.
      <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Pivotal recommends leaving this errand selected to keep the tile configuration up-to-date.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Run Template Uploader</td>
    <td>Applies Elasticsearch-specific configurations to generic components of a9s Elasticsearch for PCF. 
        This errand must run at least once. Deactivating this errand may speed up the deployment of tiles.
      <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Pivotal recommends leaving this errand selected to keep the tile configuration up-to-date.</p>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Run Broker Registrar</td>
    <td>Registers the a9s Elasticsearch for PCF service broker with Elastic Runtime to make the service available in the marketplace.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Run Broker Deregistrar</td>
    <td>Deregisters the a9s Elasticsearch for PCF service broker with Elastic Runtime and removes the service from the marketplace.
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Run Smoke Tests</td>
    <td>This errand runs basic tests against your a9s Elasticsearch for PCF installation to confirm configuration. 
        Tests typically take over 30 minutes. 
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>

###<a id='resource-config'></a> Resource Config

You can configure the dimensions of the VMs that host the a9s Elasticsearch for PCF components. 
This configuration does not cover the dedicated Elasticsearch instances that run on VMs provided by the a9s BOSH tile for PCF. 
For more information, see [Configure Service Plan VMs](#configure-service-instance).

<p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: Pivotal recommends using a VM Type of large or greater to support the tile compilation.</p>

###<a id='stemcell'></a>Stemcell

If you want to use a stemcell other than the default one, upload it in the **Stemcell** pane.
